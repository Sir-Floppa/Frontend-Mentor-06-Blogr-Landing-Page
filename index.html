        Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive interface which lets you focus on one thing:
        creating content. The editor supports management of multiple blogs and
        allows easy manipulation of embeds such as images, videos, and Markdown.
        Extensibility with plugins and themes provide easy ways to add
        functionality or change the looks of a blog.

        Increase the usability of your blog by adding customized categories,
        sections, format, or flow. With this functionality, you’re in full
        control.
